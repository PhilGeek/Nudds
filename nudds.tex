\section{The Neo-Berkelean Framework} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_neo_berkelean_framework}

Matt's discussion of the objects of audition occurs within a neo-Berkelean framework. To bring out the major features of that framework, I want to briefly consider an alternative.

\citet{Berkeley:1734fk} follows Aristotle in maintaining that sound is the proper object of audition. Berkeley maintains, in addition, that sound is the \emph{only} object of audition. Strictly speaking, we hear sounds and not their material sources. In part he argues for this by distinguishing sounds from their sources. Sounds have acoustical properties that their sources lack, and insofar as material sources lack acoustical properties they are inaudible. 

The neo-Berkelean accepts that sound is the proper object of audition. They accept as well that the acoustical properties of sounds distinguish them from their sources. But they deny that sound is the only object of audition. Material sources that can be perceived by other sensory modalities, such as sight, are also the objects of audition, but only derivatively---we hear the source of the sound by hearing the sound. Berkeley goes too far in denying that we hear material sources. Berkeley mistook sound's being the direct or immediate object of audition for sound's being the sole object of audition. If we allow material sources to be the indirect or mediate objects of audition---in the sense that we hear the sources of sounds by hearing sounds, then the objects of audition include not only proper sensibles but common sensibles as well.

However, in ``The Origin of the Work of Art'' Heidegger writes:
\begin{quote}
    We never really first perceive a throng of sensations, e.g., tones and noises, in the appearance of things \ldots; rather we hear the storm whistling in the chimney, we hear the three-motored plane, we hear the Mercedes in immediate distinction from the Volkswagen. Much closer to us than all sensations are the things themselves. We hear the door shut in the house and never hear acoustical sensations or even mere sounds. \citep[151--152]{Heidegger:1935uq}
\end{quote}
Nothing hangs on Heidegger's apparent acceptance of the empiricist identification of sound with acoustic sensation. What is important is Heidegger's denial of the central neo-Berkelean claim, that we hear the source of sound by hearing the sound. Rather, we hear the source of sound directly.

In undergoing an auditory experience, the material source of a sound is directly or immediately present in that experience. When we attend to our auditory experience, as Heidegger invites us to, we attend to the material sources of sounds and rarely, if at all, to the sounds in distinction from their sources. That is consistent with maintaining that hearing a material source necessarily involves accoustical sensation. And yet Heidegger is clearly denying the neo-Berkelean claim that he hear the source of a sound by hearing the sound. That is a negative result about how to characterize acoustical indirection: There is more to hearing a source by hearing its sound than the necessary accompaniment of the former by the latter.

Heidegger exaggerates when he claims that we never hear acoustical sensations or mere sounds. For he goes on to maintain that we can manage to hear sounds in distinction from their sources only by adopting the aural equivalent of the painterly attitude:
\begin{quote}
    In order to hear a bare sound we have to listen away from things, divert our ears from them, i.e., listen abstractly. \citep[152]{Heidegger:1935uq}
\end{quote}
We can get a sense of how difficult it is to adopt this attitude by considering Pierre Schaeffer's piece ``Étude aux chemins de fer'' (Railroad Study). Whereas traditional composition begins with an abstraction, the score, which is made concrete in playing it, \emph{musique concrète} begins with concrete sounds and abstracts them into a composition through tape looping and sound collage. Yet despite these distancing techniques, the material sources never completely fade from the perceived soundscape. We get a sense of the train's speed, its size, the space surrounding the tracks as well as the space of the interior given the character of the resonance. Indeed, at the end of his career, Schaeffer pronounced \emph{musique concrète} a failure, claiming, perhaps ironically, to have wasted his life. Heidegger's observation was the principle obstacle---it is very difficult to hear bare sounds, to hear sounds without also hearing their sources. And so there are limits to the degree of abstraction that can be achieved with \emph{musique concrète}.

The Berkelean alternative raises an explanatory challenge to the neo-Berkelean---\-to explain how we can experience the source of the sound by experiencing the sound. The Heideggerian alternative is a challenge to the very possibility of such an explanation. At the very least, in undergoing an auditory experience, we do not attend to the sources of the sound present in experience by attending to the sound---according to Heidegger, in normal cases, there is no sound that we are attending to. A neo-Berkelean cannot afford to be as sanguine about the Heideggerean alternative as he may be tempted to be about the Berkelean alternative. A promissory note is worth nothing in the face of evidence of inability to repay.

\section{The Objects of Vision and Audition} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_objects_of_vision_and_audition}

Vindicating the neo-Berkelean program is not Matt's aim. Rather his focus is on phenomenological contrasts between audition and vision. This, in turn, is meant to support the claim that we hear material objects by hearing things happening to them.

The phenomenological contrasts Matt draws closely parallels the contrasts that inaugurate C.D. Broad's \citeyearpar{Broad:1965dq} ``Elementary reflections on sense-perception''. % \citet[30]{Broad:1965dq} considers different forms of sense perception from a ``purely phenomenological point of view'':
% \begin{quote}
% 	By this I mean that I shall try to describe them as they appear to any unsophisticated percipient, and as they inevitably \emph{go on appearing} even to sophisticated percipients whose knowledge of the physical and physiological processes involved assures them that the appearances are largely misleading. \citep[30]{Broad:1965dq}
% \end{quote}
In a notorious passage, Broad summarizes these as follows:
\begin{quote}
	In its purely phenomenological aspect \emph{seeing} is ostensibly \emph{saltatory}. It seems to leap the spatial gap between the percipient's body and a remote region of space. Then again, it is ostensibly \emph{prehensive} of the surfaces of distant bodies as coloured and extended, and of external events as colour-occurrences \emph{localized} in remote regions of space. In its purely phenomenological aspect \emph{hearing} is ostensibly prehensive, not of bodies, but only of events or processes as occurrences of sound qualities. It is not ostensibly saltatory, for these events or processes are not heard as localized in remote restricted regions of space. They are heard rather as emanating from remote centres and pervading with diminishing intensity the surrounding space.
\end{quote}

One contrast, then, between the objects of vision and audition is temporal. Whe\-re\-as the objects of vision include bodies, events, and processes, the objects of audition include only events and processes. The objects of audition are essentially temporally extended. However, Broad follows tradition in emphasizing the temporally extended character of \emph{sounds}. His example of an event that is heard is the tolling of a bell and his example of a process that is heard is the roaring of a waterfall. On the other hand, Matt emphasizes the temporally extended character of if not sounds, then \emph{soundings}, events or processes involving the sources of sound. Within a neo-Berkelean framework there is no tension here. Indeed the temporally extended character of sound may play a role in the explanation of how we hear events and processes involving sources of sound. 

Another contrast between the objects of vision and audition is spatial:
\begin{quote}
	The flash is literally seen as an occurrence of a certain colour within a \emph{limited} region \emph{remote from} the percipient's body. It may even be seen as having a definite shape and size, as, e.g., in the case of seeing flash of fork-lightning. But the noise is not literally heard as the occurrence of a certain sound-quality within a limited region remote from the percipient's body. It is certainly not heard as having any shape and size. It seems to be heard as \emph{coming} to one from a certain direction, and it seems to be thought of as pervading with various degrees of intensity the whole of an indefinitely large region surrounding the centre from which it emanates. \citep[32]{Broad:1965dq}
\end{quote}

% Whereas Matt takes the temporal difference to be fundamental, Broad takes the spatial difference to be fundamental:

Whereas Broad contrasts seeing an object with seeing an event or process: 
\begin{quote}
	
\end{quote}
The contrast for Matt is explanatory. An explanation of seeing an event or process in terms of seeing successive states of an object may be prima facie plausible. However, the corresponding explanation for audition is unintelligible---hearing an event or process, whether a sound or a sounding, cannot be explained in terms of hearing an object. 

We see and hear events and processes. But just because we see objects as well doesn't mean that the presentation of events and process in vision is explainable in terms of the presentation of successive states of an object. Matt noncomittally describes the explanation as ``tempting''. While some have been tempted by it, I am not among them. Not all events or processes that we see involve changes to a substratum. Nietzsche's example is a flash of lighting---there is not lighting that flashes, just the flash. Flashes are unusual events. They are colored. Most events aren't colored despite having colored participants. (What color was the battle of Kosovo?) But what is presently important is they also lack substratum. So the presentation of a flash in visual experience is not explainable in terms of the presentation of successive state of a substratum since there is none.
